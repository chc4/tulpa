tulpa - make imaginary friends

i wrote a thing about how Lua is just Hoon but with by-reference and mutable variables
i really like this framing
i've wanted to make "hoon but different" for a while, so instead of using its weird
syntax use lua-ish syntax

- purely functional
- first-class contexts (getfenv(0), basically, with no upvalues/locals)
- statically strongly typed
- functions are objects are cores - balls of state with computed properties, closed over an environment. arguments are implemented as variables closed over and set before computing the "body" property.
